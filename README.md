## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload Your Resume (PDF)**  
   → It gets embedded and stored in a vector DB (Chroma).

2. **Ask Questions**  
   → RAG retrieves context chunks relevant to the question.

3. **LLM Processes Context**  
   → A structured and human-like answer is generated.

4. **Multi-Session Chat**  
   → You can start new sessions or revisit previous ones.
